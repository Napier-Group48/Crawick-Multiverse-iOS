The Amphitheatre – which can hold 5,000 people – is at the heart of the Crawick Multiverse. It captures the beauty of a total eclipse, replicating its iconic shapes and forms with a circle of boulders and ridges, representing the Sun. The Amphitheatre faces due south, and two glittering lagoons add to its magic and drama.
