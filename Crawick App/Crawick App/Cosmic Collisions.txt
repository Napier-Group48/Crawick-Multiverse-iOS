The Crawick Multiverse’s most recent artwork is the stunning Cosmic Collisions, installed in summer 2017 to celebrate the second anniversary of the park opening.

The Cosmic Collisions installation explores how some collisions can be incredibly destructive while others are highly creative. One of its key features is two large circular rusty saw blades, shaped like spiral galaxies crashing into each other.
