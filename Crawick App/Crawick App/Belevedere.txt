The Belvedere, the highest point of Crawick Multiverse, and the northern lookout, offers a 360º view of the surrounding countryside and settlements. As you look from the top, along the north-south path you can see the nearby railroad viaduct and other distant landmarks. Atop the Belvedere sits a stone hand with a finger pointing at the sky, aiming directly at the North Star, Polaris.
