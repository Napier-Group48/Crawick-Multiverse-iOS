The Comet Walk takes you along a ridge with scalloped edges, four of which have edges of white-yellow sandstone to emulate comets’ tails. These are positioned so the comets are being pulled into their elliptical trajectories by the Sun, represented by the Amphitheatre at the heart of Crawick Multiverse.
