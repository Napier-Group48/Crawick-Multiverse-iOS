Welcome to The Crawick Multiverse, a hidden gem nested in a bowl of rolling hills in the heart of Dumfries and Galloway (Upper Nithsdale).

This major land restoration project has transformed a former open cast coal mine into a spectacular artland and public park.

The ecology of the site, and the materials found within it, inspired its design which is based around space, astronomy and cosmology.

Today the site is cared for by the Crawick Multiverse Trust, a charity registered in Scotland (SCO39940). By visiting, you are helping preserve and maintain Crawick Multiverse for the present and for future generations to come.
