The Multiverse is a corkscrew path constructed mostly from mudstone composed of black and white layers. It represents the whole ensemble of universes, and the stones are carved with lines representing the different types of universe and their different fates.

The concept of the multiverse sits at the interface of science and philosophy. Is our universe and everything in it – all the stars, planets, nebulae, and galaxies that we can see – just one of perhaps an infinite number of other universes? If so, do they share the same laws of physics as our universe, or are they all utterly unique?
