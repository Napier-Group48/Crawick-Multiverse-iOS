The spiral galaxies of Andromeda and our Milky Way are represented with two towering mounds of earth standing at 25 and 15 metres high, with boulders atop each.

Unlike most of the other 100 billion galaxies which are travelling away from us, Andromeda and the Milky Way are heading towards one another at speed and are predicted to be drawn together by gravity in four billion years’ time. The galaxy mounds represent this ‘cosmic ballet’ of the two galaxies coming together and stripping one another into long lines of stars and planets. Red sandstone boulders at the base signify the long lines of matter, whilst giant boulders on top of the two spiralling mounds symbolise other cosmological events and phenomena such as black holes.
