The spiral galaxies of Andromeda and our Milky Way are represented with two towering mounds of earth standing at 25 and 15 metres high, with boulders atop each.

Our galaxy, the Milky Way, contains hundreds of billions of stars, of which the Sun is just one. Recent scientific advances have revealed that almost every star in our galaxy will have many planets around it, some orbiting the “Goldilocks Zone” where conditions are not too hot, not too cold, but just right for liquid water and maybe even alien life.

The Milky Way and the larger Andromeda galaxy mounds each have lagoons which will fill with water and add to their striking visual impact.
