Intersection boulders mark additional pathways which run east and west and there are also two shelter seats constructed with huge boulders.

The North / South Avenue aligns the Crawick Multiverse with the stars above. Stand here at night and gaze along the line of standing stones northwards to the highest point on the site.

Our ancestors have built such stone monuments, aligned with the cosmos, for millennia.
